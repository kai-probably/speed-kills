# Speed vs Time: A Diminishing Returns Showcase
An interactive model that visualizes how vehicle speed affects:
- **travel time per 100 km**
- **fuel consumption**
- **diminishing returns of speed**
- **remaining potential to gain time**
- **optimal driving zones**

The goal is to provide a simple, intuitive tool for understanding why *going faster doesn’t always save as much time as people expect*, and why fuel and risk both rise disproportionately at high speeds.

## 🧠 Concept Overview

### Travel Time
Travel time per 100 km follows a simple formula:
time = 6000 / speed
This makes it very clear how diminishing returns work:
- increasing from 60 → 80 km/h saves **15 minutes**
- increasing from 120 → 140 km/h saves **~2 minutes**
- increasing from 160 → 200 km/h saves **less than 1 minute**

The faster you already are, the less time you can save by going even faster.



### Remaining Speed Benefit (Potential)

To visualize diminishing returns more intuitively, we normalize “improvement potential” between two anchor speeds:
30 km/h = 100% potential left
200 km/h = 0% potential left
This shows *how much benefit is still available* by going faster.  
The bar shrinks and changes color as speed increases.



### Fuel Consumption (Simplified Model)

A lightweight cubic model approximates the typical fuel efficiency curve:
- best around 70–90 km/h
- worsens above 100 km/h
- rises steeply past 130 km/h

This is not tied to a specific car but reflects general aerodynamic and engine-load behaviors.



### Driving Zones

The speed bar is divided into clear, color-coded zones:

| Speed Range | Zone Description |
|-------------|------------------|
| 50–80 km/h  | Win–win: fast & efficient |
| 80–100 km/h | Fuel-efficiency sweet spot |
| 100–120 km/h | Time-efficiency plateau |
| 120–140 km/h | Risk rising |
| 140–200 km/h | Crash severity increases super-linearly |

The goal is intuitive communication, not preaching.

## TL;DR

I used T(v)=6000/v and defined a cut-off where the next +10 km/h stops saving a meaningful amount of time; solving that gives about 93.7 km/h.
The *cut-off* is roughly one minute saved per 100 km for the next +10 km/h. 
Below that, gains shift from minutes to seconds, which I defined as the “not worth it” point.
